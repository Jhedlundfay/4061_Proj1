/*
    Our group was able to manage the workload of this project fairly well.

   (1) To start off, Zaffer was able to solve our warm up (phase 1). In that code,
   we were able to both traverse the array of nodes (given) using a for loop,
   as well as using recursion (which is the version we used to develop the rest
   of our solutions for this project).

   (2) Meanwhile, John created the backbone of our fork_exec function, which is
   called within the depth-first-traversal when appropriate.

   (3) Chris updated both of the above functions to meet the printing standards for emulating gnu make,
       along with fixing an error with timestamps of files.  He also debugged the code with trial and error on
       running ./make4061 on all test cases given.

    All other details were mostly done collaboratively.
